# Programming Bootcamp - Introduction 0.0

Written by Drake Lambert 4/2/2018

## About

This is the introduction of Programming Bootcamp. For this session I just want to introduce you to the types of problems we will learn to solve and the names of the technology we will be using.

## Hopeful Outcomes

At the end of all of this informal program, I just want one thing:

- You should be able to develop and deploy an imgur clone

This probably sounds daunting at first, but I think we can handle it as a team.

## On Your Own

When I read technical articles, I usually read them three times.

I read them the first time at my normal reading pace, not really pausing to make sure I comprehend every word and phrase. If I did that, I'd be reading for hours. Then, I'll take a moment to think about what I really wanted to know from the article. 

Next, I'll go back through the article a second time, focusing in on what I find interesting, what I don't comprehend, and what I know I'm there to learn.

The third time I re-read is when I'm putting something into practice. Programming isn't a test, and the only people who will shame you for looking at reference material are so far beneath you that they don't even know that they're ignorant.

I'll leave you with a link to an article that I grabbed from the internet. I enjoyed it and thought it was a good mix of practical and technical. Please read it at your leisure and let me know if you have any questions.
